QRTLib addresses the gap in quantum computing by providing a unified framework for implementing these transforms efficiently on quantum hardware. Unified Framework The first complete implementation of Quantum Hartley, Cosine, and Sine transforms of various types within a single library. LCU Technique Introduces a quantum Hartley transform based on Linear Combination of Unitaries, achieving a reduction in circuit size compared to prior methods. Circuit Optimization Novel optimization strategies including two's-complement arithmetic and or-tree constructions to remove large multi-controlled operations. Native Qiskit Support Built directly for the Qiskit ecosystem, making it easy for researchers and developers to integrate real transforms into their existing quantum algorithms.
